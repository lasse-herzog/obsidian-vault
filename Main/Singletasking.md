### Singletasking
The operating system only runs one Program at a time. Multiple programs are therefore executed sequentialy.

Multitasking means that the OS supports running multiple programs at the same time. This is achieved by utilizing multiple cores or through switching to another process during an I/O operation. The overhead generated through switching processes can be neglected when compared to the performance gained.
