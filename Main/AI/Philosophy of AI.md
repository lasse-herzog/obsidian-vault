The very nature of the term “artificial intelligence” brings up philosophical questions whether intelligent behavior implies or requires the existence of a mind, and to what extent is consciousness replicable as computation.
One of the most prominent tests for intelligence is the [[Turing test]]. It assumes that if a being is intelligent it cannot be distinguished from another intelligent entity. One criticism of the Turing test is that it measures more if a computer behaves human rather than if its intelligent. 

Some made the point that intelligence might not be the same as intelligent behavior. One of the best known arguments to this thesis is the [[Chinese Room argument]].
