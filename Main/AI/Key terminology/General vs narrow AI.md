Narrow AI refers to AI that handles one task. General AI, or Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to a machine that can handle any intellectual task. All the AI methods we use today fall under narrow AI, with general AI being in the realm of science fiction. In fact, the ideal of AGI has been all but abandoned by the AI researchers because of lack of progress towards it in more than 50 years despite all the effort. In contrast, narrow AI makes progress in leaps and bounds.
