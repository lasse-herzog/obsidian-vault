A related dichotomy is “strong” and “weak” AI. This boils down to the philosophical distinction between being intelligent and acting intelligently, which was emphasized by [[John Searle]]. Strong AI would amount to a “mind” that is genuinely intelligent and self-conscious. Weak AI is what we actually have, namely systems that exhibit intelligent behaviors despite being “mere“ computers.
