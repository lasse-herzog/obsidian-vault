## My own Definition
1. "cool things that computers can't do"
2.  machines imitating intelligent human behavior
3.  autonomous and adaptive systems

The first definition "cool things that computers can't do" emphasizes the fact that many tasks which where once considered AI, e.g. OCR, aren't nowadays. However I think that this definition is misleading because computers are the basis for all modern day AI. The second definition is true for most modern day systems considered AI but I don't think that human behavior should be the main focus of the definition. The third definition contains the terms "Autonomy" and "Adaptivity" which I think are essential for defining AI. 
AI is the ability of a machine to autonomously adapt their behavior based on the information it perceives and inferes.
