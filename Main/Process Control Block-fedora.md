A [[Processes|Process]] is represented by a **process control block (PCB)**. The PCB contains information about:
- [[Process state]]
- CPU Registers and Stack Pointer
- CPU-scheduling information, e.g. process priority, pointer to scheduling queues
- Memory-mangament information
- Accounting information, e.g. CPU time, time limits, account number, process number
- I/O status information, e.g. allocated devices, list of open files
