Normaly there are multiple [[Device Controllers|device controllers]] each responsible for a certain type of device connected through a common bus.  To start an I/O operation, the [[device driver]] loads the appropritate registers within the device controller. The device controller, in turn, examines the contents of these registers to determine what action to take. The controller starts to transfer the data from the device to the to its local buffer. Once the transfer is complete the device controller informs the device driver via an interrupt that it has finished operation. The device driver then returns control to the operating system, possibly returning data or a pointer to the data if the operation was read. For other operations, the device driver returns status information.

For bulk data movement [[direct memory access (DMA)]] is used to reduce overhead.
