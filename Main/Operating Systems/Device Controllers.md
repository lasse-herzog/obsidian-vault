A device controller is responsible for a certain type of device. Depending on the controller multiple devices may be attached to a single controller. E.g.  7 or more devices may be attached to the [[small computer-systems interface (SCSI)]] controller. A device controller maintains some local buffer storage and a set of general purpose registers. It is responsible for moving data between the peripheral devices and its local buffer storage. Typivcally, [[operating systems]] have a [[device driver]] for each device controller. This device driver understands the device controller and provides the rest of the operating system with a uniform interface to the device.
