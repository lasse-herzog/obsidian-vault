In the Chinese Room Argument [[John Searle]] describes an experiment where a person who doesn’t know Chinese is locked in a room. Outside the room is a person who can slip notes written in Chinese inside the room through a mail slot. The person inside the room is given a big manual where she can find detailed instructions for responding to the notes she receives from the outside.

Searle argued that even if the person outside the room gets the impression that he is in a conversation with another Chinese-speaking person, the person inside the room does not understand Chinese. Likewise, his argument continues, even if a machine behaves in an intelligent manner, for example, by passing the [[Turing test]], it doesn’t follow that it is intelligent or that it has a “mind” in the way that a human has. The word “intelligent” can also be replaced by the word “conscious” and a similar argument can be made.
