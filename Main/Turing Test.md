In the test, a human interrogator interacts with two players, A and B, by exchanging written messages (in a chat). If the interrogator cannot determine which player, A or B, is a computer and which is a human, the computer is said to pass the test. The argument is that if a computer is indistinguishable from a human in a general natural language conversation, then it must have reached human-level intelligence.
